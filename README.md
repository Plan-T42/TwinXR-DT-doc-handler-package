# TwinXR: Unity package of DT-doc handler

TwinXR is a method we developed to explore the synergies between Digital Twins (DT) and Extened Reality (XR), and their interoperability and interchangeabilty, by introducing an ontology-based approach in industrial Extended Reality (XR) applications. (Related publication is coming out soon, and we will add the link here.) 

To ease use of the TwinXR method, the repository provides a Unity package for creating the DT-doc module that enables bi-directional data flow with digital twin features between XR applications and DT documents on the [Twinbase](https://github.com/twinbase/twinbase) server,  as well as the Twin ID input through QR code scanning.

The pacakge is extracted from the Unity project ["TwinXR: HoloCrane Unity Demo"](https://github.com/Plan-T42/TwinXR-HoloCrane-Unity-Demo), a TwinXR-compatible Windows Mixed reality Application running on Microsoft HoloLens 2 device for operating overhead cranes. The application accesses and utilizes the Twinbase and the DT documents defined there in the "[TwinXR: Twinbase for HoloCrane](https://github.com/Plan-T42/TwinXR-TwinBase-for-HoloCrane)" project. Together, they demostrate the use of the "TwinXR" method in industrial applications.

The creation of the package followed the Unity documentation page ["Creating custom packages"](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPackages.html). To install and use the package, you can refer to the Unity documentation page ["Installing from a Git URL"](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).
